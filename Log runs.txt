
RESULTS 2ND BATCH
Main results presented to Franjo, comprising 8 rules and 27 parameter sets.

Pruebitas
A run made with the code Pruebitas, only CNN 3 hidden, all 27 parameter sets, to make sure that after code modifications, the results where consistent. So far, they were.

WeirdBehaviour
Three replicate runs of the Complex Neural Network 2 Hidden under Random20 updates number and Evolving Initial Estimate, to see if the weird behaviour seen in RESULTS 2ND BATCH would happen again. It didn't... The code used was the same as in RESULTS 2ND BATCH 

Pruebitas2
Still empty

IndividualUpdatesNo
A run made with all rules and 18 parameter sets that included Random updates number. The code was modified (code with same name as the simulation) to make variation in updates number act on individuals within generations and not only on generations. One of Franjo's suggestions of variations that should be compared. Had to stop the simulation before it finished...

Random20
A run made with the code Pruebitas2, only CNN 2 hidden under Random20 updates number and Evolving Initial Estimate, to make sure that after code modifications, the results where consistent. So far, they were.

Comparison
Comprised 8 rules and 27 parameter sets, but only 2000 generations, using code Pruebitas2 and RESULTS 2ND BATCH in parallel. The aim was again, to verify consistency with each other. So far, Error Run, Locusn and InitialEstimate where all consistent. ErrorGeneral and Locus General haven't been tested yet.

SpeedTest
RESULTS 2ND BATCH = 06:12, Pruebitas 2 = 06:28

CNN_NoBias
All 27 parameter sets, only CNN 3 with no bias. One of Franjo's suggestions of an additional rule to compare with the others. 

NetworksWithUpdatesCounter
All 27 parameter sets, only NN with Bias and Updates and CNN 3 with UpdateCounts. Other of Franjo's suggestions of an additional rule to compare with the others. 

EvolvingBNN
A run made with the code Trimmer2012__V4_2, only BNN under Fixed updates number and Evolving Initial Estimate, to make sure that after code modifications, the results where consistent with those in RESULTS 2ND BATCH. Inconsistencies where found... I am investigating what happened.

RESULTS 3RD BATCH
Run with code Trimmer2012__V4_2_1
I think it was to include all loci and 11 types

RESULTS IndividualUpdatesNo
Run with code Trimmer2012__V4_2_2
Basically the same as the previous but randoms were with individual variation in random

RESULTS 4TH BATCH 
Run with code Trimmer2012__V4_3_1
To make them individual variation, include all 11 types, correct the initial estimate. 

RESULTS CNN AllBias
Run with code Trimmer2012__V4_3_2
Just to see what happens by adding biases to all processing nodes of CNN

RESULTS CNN Replicates
Run with code Trimmer2012__V4_3_3
Several runs of CNN to study polymorphism. To continue running, just have to copy the code from the folder 9 times, select sequentialy the parameter sets and include the seeds. 

RESULTS 5TH BATCH
Run with code Trimmer2012__V5_1_1. The trials loop was moved inwards, so that it was immediately before going to the learning phase, but the probability values were set from the beginning of the generation. So now, the number of updates and random initial estimate (both when applicable), are the same throughout the life of the individual, in contrast with 4th BATCH, where there were different for each trial even for the same individual. No substantial difference detected.

RESULTS BNNwB Replicates
Run with code Trimmer2012__V4_3_4. The same as RESULTS CNN Replicates, but polymorphism studied in Basic Neural Networks with Bias.

RESULTS CNN 2H Replicates
Run with code Trimmer2012__V4_3_5. The same as RESULTS CNN Replicates, but polymorphism studied in Complex Neural Networks 2 Hidden.

RESULTS Weissing Mendez Rule
Run with code Trimmer2012__V4_4_1. The Weissing Mendez Rule, derived from the observations of the Rescorla Wagner Plots, was implemented. Made to be comparable against RESULTS 4TH BATCH. Let's see how it goes!!
